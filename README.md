Exploratory Data Analysis on Soccer
This data set brings together information concerning the 2689 players (name, position, nationality) as well as the game strategies used to define the level of play of each player.
Our analysis is composed of three parts:

The first part is to clean up our database after importing and loading our package. In this section we remodel our database so that we can rename columns to perform statistical performance calculations for players.
We identify all possible positions of each player in order to define the categories (defense, midfielders and attackers).

The 2nd part consists of bringing a statistical study to our analysis by analyzing the important details to determine the performance level of the players, according to age, and the number of goals scored

The 3rd part consists of building our team by choosing the selection criteria to determine the players according to the position category:
For the defender category, we will choose players with excellent defensive play with good ball passing skills.
Concerning the midfielders, they must adapt to the game by sometimes adopting a defensive attitude to protect their camp and sometimes an offensive attitude with a capacity to attack and communicate with the attackers.
Finally, the attackers will be selected according to their ability to score the most goals, with excellent offensive play and preferably young.

We conclude our study with a combination of 2 types of game simulation by explaining the strategy used by each type of game and the objectives to be achieved and the choice to adopt depending on the game configuration.

Our analysis is interspersed with graphs highlighting the strategies for choosing players in relation to the age criterion and also with graphs explaining the criteria sought to select our players according to the 3 categories of play (defense-midfield-attack).
