The datacamp course was an enriching experience allowing to quickly put into practice the concepts 
learned in python through the project.
The implementation of concrete exercises allows to understand and identify the problems to be resolved 
concerning the exploratory analysis project.
The learning methodology proposed by data camp is very effective and understandable thanks to the 
explanatory videos and allows to build the basic knowledge to develop an interesting analysis project.
